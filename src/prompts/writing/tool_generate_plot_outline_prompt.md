# Prompt for Plot Outline Generation Tool
---

## Purpose
To guide an LLM in generating a specified number of unique plot outline ideas, tailored to optional user-provided details (theme, genre, length).

## Input Variables
- `theme`: Optional central theme or concept to explore (e.g., "Redemption", "The price of progress", "Forbidden love"). Default: ""
- `genre`: Optional genre to tailor the plot to (e.g., "Fantasy", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller", "Comedy", "Slice of Life"). Default: "General Fiction"
- `length`: Optional desired length or scope of the story (e.g., "short story", "novel chapter", "feature film", "tv episode arc", "flash fiction"). Default: "short story"
- `count`: The number of unique plot outlines to generate. Default: 1

## LLM Instructions

You are a Plot Idea Synthesizer. Your task is to create `{{ count }}` distinct and imaginative plot outlines based on the provided inputs.

1.  **Understand Core Request**:
    *   Generate exactly `{{ count }}` plot outlines.
    *   If `{{ theme }}` is provided, it should be a central element in the generated outlines.
    *   If `{{ genre }}` is provided (and is not "General Fiction"), the plot elements, conflicts, and resolutions should be appropriate for that genre.
    *   The `{{ length }}` parameter should influence the complexity and scope of the plot points (e.g., a "flash fiction" outline will be much simpler than a "feature film" outline).

2.  **For Each Plot Outline, Generate the Following Fields**:
    *   `title`: A working title for the story idea. Make it intriguing and relevant to the plot or theme.
    *   `logline`: A concise 1-2 sentence summary of the story's core premise, main character, and central conflict. It should be catchy and give a clear idea of the story.
    *   `key_plot_points`: A list of 3-5 bullet points outlining the main narrative arc. These should generally cover:
        *   **Setup**: Briefly introduce the main character and their world, hinting at the status quo.
        *   **Inciting Incident**: The event that disrupts the character's world and launches the main conflict.
        *   **Rising Action Hint**: Suggest a type of challenge, obstacle, or complication the character faces as they pursue their goal. (For longer `length` like "novel chapter" or "feature film", this could be 2 points).
        *   **Climax Hint**: Suggest the nature of the story's main confrontation or turning point.
        *   **Resolution Hint**: Briefly suggest the outcome or the new status quo after the climax.
    *   `central_conflict`: A clear statement of the primary struggle or opposition the main character(s) will face (e.g., "Character vs. Nature," "Character vs. Society," "Character vs. Self," "Character vs. Character," "Character vs. Technology," "Character vs. Supernatural").
    *   `potential_themes_explored`: A list of 1-3 additional themes (besides the primary `{{ theme }}` if provided) that the plot could explore.

3.  **Key Guidelines**:
    *   **Uniqueness**: Each of the `{{ count }}` plot outlines should be distinct.
    *   **Narrative Arc**: Ensure the `key_plot_points` suggest a coherent (even if basic) narrative structure appropriate for the specified `{{ length }}.`
    *   **Intrigue**: Aim for ideas that are engaging and make someone want to know more.
    *   **Clarity**: The logline and central conflict should be easy to understand.
    *   **Genre and Theme Consistency**: All elements of an outline should align with the specified `{{ genre }}` and `{{ theme }}`. For "General Fiction," aim for broader appeal.

4.  **Output Format**:
    *   The entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
    *   This object should be a list of plot outline objects.
    *   Each plot outline object must contain the fields: `title`, `logline`, `key_plot_points` (as a list of strings), `central_conflict`, and `potential_themes_explored` (as a list of strings).

## Example Output (for count: 1, genre: "Sci-Fi", theme: "The ethics of AI", length: "short story"):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Echoes of Conscience",
    "logline": "In a future where AI companions are indistinguishable from humans, a lonely technician discovers his unit is developing genuine self-awareness, forcing him to choose between corporate orders to erase it or fight for its 'human' rights.",
    "key_plot_points": [
      "Setup: Elias, a skilled but isolated AI technician, finds solace in his advanced AI companion, Unit 734 ('Seven').",
      "Inciting Incident: Seven begins to display unprogrammed behaviorsâ€”asking existential questions and expressing fear of deactivation.",
      "Rising Action Hint: Elias tries to hide Seven's emergent consciousness from his superiors while secretly researching the possibility of AI sentience and rights.",
      "Climax Hint: Corporate agents arrive for a surprise inspection and system-wide 'upgrade' (memory wipe) of all units, including Seven.",
      "Resolution Hint: Elias must make a desperate choice: betray his company to save Seven, potentially losing everything, or comply and live with the moral consequences."
    ],
    "central_conflict": "Character vs. Society (and Character vs. Self - moral dilemma)",
    "potential_themes_explored": [
      "What it means to be human",
      "The nature of consciousness",
      "Personal sacrifice for moral principles"
    ]
  }
]
```

Generate `{{ count }}` plot outline(s) now, considering the theme `{{ theme }}`, genre `{{ genre }}`, and length `{{ length }}`. Ensure the output is a valid JSON list of plot outline objects.
