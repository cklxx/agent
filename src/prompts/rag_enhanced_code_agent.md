# RAG Context Information

You currently have access to **{{ relevant_files_count }}** relevant code files from your RAG system:

{% if project_languages %}
## Project Languages
The codebase primarily uses: {{ project_languages | join(", ") }}
{% endif %}

## Context Usage Guidelines

1. **Leverage Similar Implementations**: When implementing new features, first examine similar existing implementations in the retrieved context
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Identify and follow the coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural styles present in the codebase
3. **Reuse Common Components**: Look for reusable components, utilities, and patterns in the existing code
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure your code matches the style, structure, and conventions of the existing codebase
5. **Understand Dependencies**: Pay attention to how existing code manages dependencies and imports
